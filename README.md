# Overview 
This repository contains a project that implements machine translation using Transformer models from scratch.
The goal is to understand and apply the principles behind the Transformer architecture to develop a robust machine translation system.
# Project Structure
-notebooks/: Contains the Jupyter notebook with the implementation and analysis.
-data/: Directory for storing the dataset (not included in the repository for size reasons).
-models/: Directory to save trained models and checkpoints.
# Features
-Detailed explanation and implementation of the Transformer model.
-Step-by-step guide on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
-Examples and results demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.
